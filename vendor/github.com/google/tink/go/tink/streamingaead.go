/*
StreamingAEAD is an interface for streaming authenticated encryption with associated data.

Streaming encryption is typically used for encrypting large plaintexts such as large files.
Tink may eventually contain multiple interfaces for streaming encryption depending on the
supported properties. This interface supports a streaming interface for symmetric encryption with
authentication. The underlying encryption modes are selected so that partial plaintext can be
obtained fast by decrypting and authenticating just a part of the ciphertext.

Instances of StreamingAEAD must follow the OAE2 definition as proposed in the paper "Online
Authenticated-Encryption and its Nonce-Reuse Misuse-Resistance" by Hoang, Reyhanitabar, Rogaway
and Viz√°r https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/189.pdf

	// and has to be passed in as parameter for decryption.
